### Overview about 2048 game 

2048 is a simple yet addictive sliding tile puzzle game created by Gabriele Cirulli in 2014. It can be played on mobile devices, web browsers, or desktop.

🔹**Objective:**
Combine numbered tiles on a 4×4 grid to create a tile with the number 2048.

🔹**How to Play:**
The game starts with two tiles (usually 2 or 4) on a 4×4 board.
You use the arrow keys (or swipe on mobile) to move all tiles in one of four directions: up, down, left, or right.
When two tiles with the same number collide during a move, they merge into one tile with the sum of their values (e.g., 2 + 2 = 4).
After each move, a new tile (2 or 4) appears at a random empty spot on the board.

🔹**Winning and Losing:**
You win the game by creating a tile with the number 2048.
You lose when the board fills up and no more moves are possible.

🔹**Strategy Tips:**
Keep your highest tile in a corner.
Try not to move up (or in a direction that breaks your corner strategy).
Think ahead: merging small tiles now can open up space for bigger moves later.
Plan your moves instead of swiping randomly.

🔹 **Why It’s Popular:**
Easy to learn, hard to master.
Quick to play, with endless replay value.
Simple interface, no distractions.
